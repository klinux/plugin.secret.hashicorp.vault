# Skeleton Secrets Plugin

This is a skeleton plugin which implements the GoCD [Secret Plugin](https://plugin-api.gocd.org/current/secrets) endpoint. This plugin allows retrieving of secrets that are stored in encrypted files. This is merely a skeleton plugin that plugin developers can fork to get quickly started with writing notification plugins for GoCD.

## Getting started

* Edit the file `build.gradle`
* Edit the `SecretConfig.java` class to add any configuration fields that is needed for the secret manager of your choice.
* Edit the `secrets.template.html` file which contains the view for the configuration required to access secrets.
* Implement the `SecretConfigValidator.java` class to add validations for the secret configs.
* Implement the `SecretConfigLookupExecutor.java` class to resolve the keys utilized in GoCD.

## Building the code base

To build the jar, run `./gradlew clean test assemble`
